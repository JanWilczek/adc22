### Jumpstart Guide To Deep Learning In Audio For Absolute Beginners: From No Experience And No Datasets To A Deployed Model

A companion repository for the Audio Developers Conference 2022 talk containing the live demo.

## Notes on Resources

1. The dataset for the input signal was assembled using the [Fraunhofer IDMT datasets](https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/datasets.html), guitar and bass in particular, thus, I cannot include it in the repository. Feel free to download the dataset from the Fraunhofer website using the form provided therein.
1. The diode clipper target data was synthesized using [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) and a model provided by [Alec Wright](https://github.com/Alec-Wright) (*DiodeClipper.asc* file).
1. If you want to use some ready-made dataset, you can check out Alec's [Guitar Amplifier Modeling repo](https://github.com/Alec-Wright/Automated-GuitarAmpModelling) or his [Time-Varying Effects repo](https://github.com/Alec-Wright/Automated-TimeVaryFX).
